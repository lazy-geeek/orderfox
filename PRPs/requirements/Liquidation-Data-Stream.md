## FEATURE:

In the frontend in the lightweight chart, there is a price scale on the right side of the chart that shows the price of the asset. this seems to be limited to 2 decimal places atm, which is not sufficient for many assets, especially cryptocurrencies.
This price scale should use the price precision of the symbol. the price precision is already available via the symbol service of the backend.
It may be already be passed to the frontend, please check this. if not, it should be passed to the frontend and used in the lightweight chart.
